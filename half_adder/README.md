ðŸŽ¯Half Adder (Gate-Level Modeling)

ðŸ“Œ Project Description:
 This project implements half adder using Verilog in gate level modeling.
 
 Half adder is a fundamental combinational circuit in digital electronics .which performs  addition of two single bit binary numbers.
 
 it produces two outputs:
 
 sum--> result of xor operation
 
 carry --> result of and operation
 
 âš¡ Features

 
1.Designed using basic logic gates (XOR, AND)

2.Simple gate-level modeling in Verilog

3.Includes testbench for functional verification

4.Verified using simulation waveform

5.truth table validation is included
