ðŸ“ŒOverview

This project implements a 3-to-8 decoder in Verilog using structural modeling. The design is built hierarchically, where a 2-to-4 decoder with an enable input is first implemented using basic logic gates (and and not). Two instances of this 2-to-4 decoder are then combined to construct the 3-to-8 decoder, with the most significant bit of the input acting as the enable signal to select either the lower or upper half of the outputs. A testbench is included to verify the design by applying all possible 3-bit input combinations and monitoring the corresponding outputs. The simulation results confirm that for each input, exactly one output line is set high while all others remain low, as expected for a decoder. This project demonstrates hierarchical design, gate-level modeling, and functional verification using Verilog HDL.
