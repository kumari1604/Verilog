ðŸ“ŒOverview

This project implements a 4-bit digital comparator in Verilog to compare two binary numbers a and b of size 4 bits each. The design is constructed hierarchically using a single-bit comparator module (comp1) as the basic building block. The comp1 module determines whether two single-bit inputs are equal, greater, or less, by generating outputs e0, g0, and l0 using simple logic gates. Four such comparators are instantiated inside the comparator4bit module, one for each corresponding bit of the input operands. The final outputs are then derived by combining the intermediate results according to standard comparator logic equations: the equality signal e is asserted only when all four bits are equal (e3e2e1e0), the greater-than signal g is obtained through a priority logic expression (g3 + e3g2 + e3e2g1 + e3e2e1g0), and the less-than signal l is expressed as (l3 + e3l2 + e3e2l1 + e3e2e1l0). This ensures that the most significant bit (MSB) has the highest priority in deciding the comparison result.

To verify the design, a testbench (tb_comparator4bit) applies different input patterns and observes the comparator outputs. For example, when a=0000 and b=0010, the circuit correctly sets l=1 (indicating a<b). When both inputs are equal (a=1000, b=1000), the equality signal e=1. For a=1111, b=0000, the greater output g=1 as expected. Other cases like a=1011, b=1010 confirm correct greater-than detection. The simulation results validate the correctness of the hierarchical comparator design.

This project highlights the power of modular and hierarchical design in Verilog, where simple one-bit building blocks can be combined to implement more complex multi-bit systems. The same method can be scaled to design comparators of higher bit-widths (e.g., 8-bit or 16-bit) by following the same structural approach.
