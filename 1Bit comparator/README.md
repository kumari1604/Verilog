1-Bit Comparator (Verilog)    --> GATE LEVEL MODELING

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a 1-bit digital comparator using Verilog.
A comparator is a combinational circuit that compares two binary inputs (a and b) and produces three outputs:

e (equal) â†’ High when a = b

g (greater) â†’ High when a > b

l (less) â†’ High when a < b

âš¡ Design Explanation

XNOR gate is used to check equality (a == b).

NOT + AND gates are used to determine greater and less conditions:

g = a Â· b'

l = a' Â· b
Thus, the outputs correctly represent the relationship between a and b.
