ðŸ“ŒOVERVIEW 

This project implements a 2-to-4 line decoder using gate-level modeling in Verilog. A decoder is a combinational circuit that converts binary inputs into a one-hot coded output, where exactly one output line is activated for each unique input combination. The design takes a 2-bit input vector x[1:0] and produces a 4-bit output vector y[3:0]. To achieve this, the circuit first generates inverted signals of the input lines using NOT gates. These inverted values are then combined with the original input signals through AND gates to generate the four distinct outputs. The logic expressions are: y0 = ~x1 & ~x0, y1 = ~x1 & x0, y2 = x1 & ~x0, and y3 = x1 & x0.

The testbench applies all four possible input combinations (00, 01, 10, and 11) and verifies the correctness of the output. Simulation results confirm that for each input combination, only one output is high at a time, following the expected one-hot behavior. For example, when the input is 00, output y0 is high; for input 01, output y1 is high; for input 10, output y2 is high; and for input 11, output y3 is high. This validates that the decoder works correctly and demonstrates its practical use in digital design applications such as memory addressing and instruction decoding.
