ðŸ“ŒOverview

This design describes a 2-to-4 line decoder with enable using gate-level modeling in Verilog. The circuit takes a 2-bit input x[1:0] and produces a 4-bit one-hot output y[3:0]. Additionally, it includes an enable input en that controls whether the decoder is active or not. When en = 1, the decoder functions normally, and only one of the four outputs becomes high based on the input combination. The logic is as follows: y0 = ~x1 & ~x0 & en, y1 = ~x1 & x0 & en, y2 = x1 & ~x0 & en, and y3 = x1 & x0 & en. On the other hand, when en = 0, all outputs are forced to 0, regardless of the input values, effectively disabling the decoder. This feature is widely used in digital systems for selective activation of circuits.

The testbench applies different input values to verify the functionality of the decoder in both enabled and disabled states. When en = 1, the simulation confirms the correct one-hot behavior: input 00 activates y0, input 01 activates y1, input 10 activates y2, and input 11 activates y3. When en = 0, all outputs remain at 0, irrespective of the inputs, validating the enable feature. This confirms that the design successfully implements a 2-to-4 decoder with enable, making it useful for applications such as memory selection, instruction decoding, and chip enable operations in digital systems.
