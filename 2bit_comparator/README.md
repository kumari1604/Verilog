This project implements a 2-bit digital comparator in Verilog using modular design. The comparator determines whether two 2-bit binary numbers a and b are equal, greater, or less. The design is built hierarchically by first creating a one-bit comparator module (comp1) that outputs equality (e), greater-than (g), and less-than (l) signals for single-bit inputs. Two instances of this one-bit comparator are then combined in the comparator2bit module to evaluate the comparison of 2-bit inputs. Logical gates are used to cascade the results from the least significant bit and most significant bit to produce the final outputs e2, g2, and l2, ensuring correct comparison across both bits.

The functionality of the comparator was verified using a Verilog testbench (tb_comparator2bit). Different input cases were applied to observe the outputs: when a=00 and b=10, the circuit correctly indicates that a<b; when both inputs are equal, such as a=11 and b=11 or a=10 and b=10, the equality output is set high; when a=01 and b=00 or a=10 and b=01, the greater-than output is high; and when both are 00, equality is again asserted. The simulation confirms that the comparator functions as expected for all test cases.

This project demonstrates the use of gate-level modeling, module instantiation, and hierarchical design to implement larger circuits from simpler building blocks. The approach can be extended further to create comparators for higher-bit binary numbers.
